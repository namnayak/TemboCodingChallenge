# TemboCodingChallenge
#Contains solution for the said coding challenge
#Full name of parent required
#If child name is provided bt not age, then prints age of child not provided in the list
#Given the constraint on data type and data set, i have assumed that duplicate entry for parents list can exist. for more accurate information a id key must be present in the data type to identify the person uniquely since name and age can't be uniquely
#Since there is a possibility that a parent has more than 1 child, there will be more than one entry for the same parent in the parents list, which will be considered as a different element since we have any id or key to validate if the duplicate parent entry corresponds to the same person
#Conditions to handle input having empty activities or multiple comma seperated values included
